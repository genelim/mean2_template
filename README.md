# MEAN Stack Template Starter

This is a repo for a MEAN2 Stack starter
- MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular2 and NodeJS

## Installation
1. Download the repository
2. Install npm modules: `npm install`
3. Start up the server: `npm start`
5. View in browser at http://localhost:1000

Note: MongoDB will soon be added.

Which was then customized to my personal usage on most projects
